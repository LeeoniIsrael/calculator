ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the GitHub repository for my very first project, the 4-Function Calculator App! This calculator is not just my introduction to codingâ€”it's a milestone where HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript come together to create something functional and user-friendly.

This project is a perfect embodiment of beginning with the basics. Through HTML, I laid down the structure of this application; CSS added style and appeal, making the calculator not just usable but visually engaging; and JavaScript brought it all to life, making those buttons perform real calculations.

Every line of code in this project was a new learning experience, from understanding how to manipulate the DOM to implementing logic for mathematical operations. It's a testament to the beauty of starting simple, learning by doing, and laying a solid foundation for more complex challenges ahead.

I invite you to dive into the code and explore how these three cornerstone technologies of web development come together. Whether you're a fellow student just starting your journey into coding or a seasoned developer reminiscing about your first project, I hope this calculator serves as an inspiration.

Thank you for visiting. Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements. Let's celebrate the small beginnings that pave the way for greater achievements!
